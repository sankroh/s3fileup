django-s3fileup
===============

S3FileUp is an Apache2 Licensed pluggable Django app that provides you with an
API to upload files to S3 directly from the browser, without the file ever
touching your server.

It's implemented using ``django-tastypie``, so you can reuse any of the Authorization
/Authentication schemes that your webapp uses. There is also an implementation
without any django dependencies, see the [examples](#examples) section for more
info.

3rd Party Requirements
----------------------

* boto==2.7.0
* django-tastypie==0.9.11

Usage
-----

This app exposes two resource URLs that can be used by the client. Using the example
above, the URLs are ``/uploads/s3/v1/s3put/`` and ``/uploads/s3/v1/s3get/``.

### Get an upload URL

>#### Definition
>``POST /uploads/s3/v1/s3put/``
>
>#### Parameters
>* ``s3_object_name`` (required) - Name of the file being uploaded
>* ``s3_object_type`` (optional) - Content type of the file (e.g. ``application/text``)
>* ``s3_object_size`` (optional) - Size of file in bytes
>
>These parameters are then added to the header, so S3 handles the upload appropriately.
>
>#### Example Request
>```bash
>$ curl https://my_app/uploads/s3/v1/s3put/ \
>  -u my_user \
>  -d "s3_object_name=my_awesome_movie.mov" \
>  -d "s3_object_type=video/quicktime" \
>  -d s3_object_size=3459034
>```
>
>#### Example Response
>```json
>{ "url": "https://my_domain/my_bucket/my_filename?Signature=xxxx&Expires=xxxx&AWSAccessKeyId=xxxx&x-amz-acl=xxxx" }
>```
>Errors are returned as JSON:
>```json
>{ "error": "Authentication failed" }
>```
>
>Combine the URL above with a ``HTTP PUT`` request and your file, to upload to S3.
>You can customize the bucket name, CORS config, ACL headers and a callback URL, by including
>the relevant values in ``settings.py``. See [Settings](#settings) for a full list of settings
>available.

### Get a read-only URL

>Not implemented.

Examples
--------
The ``examples`` folder contains a sample Django app with a JavaScript implementation
of a upload client.

>For those who are Django averse or just want a simple API, there is a sample
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) app in the ``flask`` branch. The Flask app does
not have any auth and has a simpler settings/configuration paradigm.
